This recounts the process of how I will complete this project:

1 - find a free API which provides data in the form of JSON files 
2 - create a database which stores these files and perform some small EDA on them 
3 - extract using python from the database and perform EDA + modelling
4 - generate report on outcomes 

BONUS - create a small website which displays these figures with some complementary results
